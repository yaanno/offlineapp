Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat.

A successor to ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals and The Paragons. The term rocksteady comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song Rock Steady. Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was Hold Me Tight (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached #5 in the United Kingdom and United States.",
